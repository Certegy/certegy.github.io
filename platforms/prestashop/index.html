<ul>
<li><strong>Title</strong> This configures the plugin title that gets displayed to the end user during checkout. By default it is configured to <strong>Oxipay</strong> but you have the option of changing it to something else such as <strong>Oxipay Australia</strong> or <strong>Oxipay Payment Gateway</strong> for instance.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="config1.png" src="../../img/platforms/prestashop/config1.png" />
<hr></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Logo</strong> This controls the Oxipay Logo that gets displayed </li>

</ul>
<p><img alt="config3.png" src="../../img/platforms/prestashop/config3.png" />
<hr></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oxipay Gateway URL</strong> This specifies the Oxipay end-point the plugin would need to communicate with for it to be able to process payments via Oxipay. Note that this is the live Oxipay Gateway URL meaning  transactions processed over it are real transactions that end up in real dollar amounts being deducted.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="config4.png" src="../../img/platforms/prestashop/config4.png" />
<hr></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oxipay Sandbox Gateway URL</strong> This specifies the test Oxipay end-point that the plugin would need to communicate with when <strong>Test Mode</strong> is enabled. This is mainly used for troubleshooting purposes particularly if we want to simulate transactions on your PrestaShop store without having real dollar amounts debited from Credit Cards.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="config5.png" src="../../img/platforms/prestashop/config5.png" />

<hr></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Key</strong> The API Key or the Encryption key is a case-sentitive alpha-numeric that is used to authenticate payment requests originating from your store. It is similar to passwords that you use to login into your online email account for instnace, and so it is vital that you protect it and don't provide it to un-authorised individuals. We might also re-cycle your API and provide you with a new one if un-authorised individuals get hold of it or if it has been compromised.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="config7.png" src="../../img/platforms/prestashop/config7.png" />
<hr></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Test</strong> Indicates whether to process payments over the live Oxipay Gateway URL resulting in real transaction; or to process it over the Oxipay Sandbox Gateway URL which only produces simulated (test) transaction with no real dollar amounts being debited. By default it should be set to <strong>No</strong> unless you are attempting to diagnose issues with our help.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="config8.png" src="../../img/platforms/prestashop/config8.png" />
